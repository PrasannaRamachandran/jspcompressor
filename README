This is a version of the HTML Compressor I found on Google code that has been modified to skip JSP code
markers (<%, %>) while compressing and strips JSP comments from the file.

This version also includes an ANT task that can be used during an automated build process to optimize
JSP files to remove the incessant "blank lines" that you get from JSP tag processing.

Removing these extra lines in these files reduces the number of bytes that needs to be compressed and 
downloaded to the client.

TODO:
* Document Ant task included in README
* Document modifications made to original source specific to JSP files.
